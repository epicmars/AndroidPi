/**
 * Implementing this interface and register it with a behavior, then you can observe the scrolling
 * event of the view that the behavior is attached.
 * <p>
 * To make the api more close to human visual instinct, the offset used in the callback method of
 * this interface is transformed. As we are scrolling vertically, we only care about offset in the
 * vertical axis, i.e. axis y.
 * <p>
 * For header view we use the bottom of the view along the axis y as the coordinate.
 * for content view we use the top the the view along axis y as the coordinate, their coordinate
 * system is the same, and the same as the parent view's original touch event coordinate system.
 * <p>
